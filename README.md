# Financial Payment Fraud Data Science Project
This repository contains the code and documentation for my financial payment fraud data science project. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately detect and classify fraudulent payment transactions.
# Project Structure
## The project is organized as follows:
data/: This directory contains the dataset used for the project. The dataset includes historical payment transaction data, with labels indicating whether each transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.
notebooks/: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that outline the different stages of the project, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
scripts/: This directory includes any helper scripts or utility functions used throughout the project.
models/: After training and evaluating the models, this directory will store the final trained models.
docs/: This directory contains any additional documentation related to the project, such as data dictionaries, project requirements, and other relevant information.
README.md: This file provides an overview of the project, including its objective, structure, and instructions for running the code.
